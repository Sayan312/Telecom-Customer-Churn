# Telecom-Customer-Churn
What is Customer Churn ?

Customer churn, also known as customer attrition, refers to the rate at which customers stop doing business with a company or brand over a specific period.

Objective:

. Here we want to analyse and visualize the various churn dynamics through available data using Python. 

Steps Overview:
1. Import the data using Python.
2. Clean the data of any null values and fill those null values with the mean of the availabe column mean.
3. Change the data type of any column if necessary for quantitative analysis.
4. Create visualizations for showing Churn w.r.t various parameters.

Inferences:
1. The Telecom service availabilty is more uniformly distributed across genders.
2. The Senior Citizen people has much lesser telecom service availablity compared to the younger population.
3. Churn rates of DSL Service and having no internet service available is much lesser than the ones who has fiber optic services.
4. The ones who use electronic check as Payment Method are more likely to stay with the service than others.
5. The ones who didn't need tech support are more likely to stay with the service than the ones who needed support and also the ones with no internet service.
6. The ones who stay on the service for longer tenure are less likely to leave. The ones to leave the service leave mostly at the beginning itself.
7. The charges for the non_churned customer majorly ranges from 0-2000 . It is also the range where majority of the churned customers lie.
